The objective of the project is to predict “HR Status”, i.e. whether a candidate is going to “join” or “not join” the company.
Specific tasks performed:
1.	Clean the data by imputing the missing values in the dataset properly
2.	Performed some basic EDA to show the distributions, central tendencies, etc of some variables
3.	Break the data into training set and test set. Create a classification model in the training set ( logistic regression, decision tree / CART, random forest)
4.	Tested the models and compared the accuracy.
